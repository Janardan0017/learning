<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><u>NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT</u></strong></p>
<ol>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">This Nondisclosure Agreement (this â€œ<strong>Agreement</strong>â€), effective
        $EffectiveDate$ (â€œ<strong>Effective Date</strong>â€), is entered into by and between $NGOName$ , a &nbsp;$StateOfIncorporation$
        corporation having offices at $ClientAddress$ (â€œ<strong>Company</strong>â€) and $RecipientCompany$, a
        [StateIncorproation] corporation having offices at $RecipientAddress$ (â€œ<strong>Recipient</strong>â€) (each
        herein referred to individually as a â€œ<strong>Party,</strong>â€ or collectively as the
        â€œ<strong>Parties</strong>â€).&nbsp; In consideration of the covenants and conditions contained herein, the
        Parties hereby agree to the following:
    </li>
    <li><strong><u>Purpose</u></strong></li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">The Parties wish to explore a business opportunity of mutual interest (the
        â€œ<strong>Opportunity</strong>â€), and in connection with the Opportunity, Company has disclosed, and may
        further disclose to Recipient certain confidential technical and business information that Company desires
        Recipient to treat as confidential.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Confidential Information</u></strong></li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><i>Definition</i>.&nbsp; â€œ<strong>Confidential Information</strong>â€ means any
        information (including any and all combinations of individual items of information) disclosed by Company to
        Recipient, including any information disclosed prior to the Effective Date, either directly or indirectly in
        writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects (including, without limitation, research, product plans,
        products, services, equipment, customers, markets, software, inventions, discoveries, ideas, processes, designs,
        drawings, hardware, formulations, specifications, product configuration information, marketing and finance
        documents, prototypes, samples, data sets, and equipment), whether or not designated as â€œconfidentialâ€ at
        the time of disclosure.&nbsp; Confidential Information may also include information of a third party that is in
        Companyâ€™s possession and is disclosed to Recipient under this Agreement.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><i>Exceptions</i>.&nbsp; Confidential Information shall not, however, include any
        information that Recipient can establish: (i)&nbsp;was publicly known or made generally available without a duty
        of confidentiality prior to the time of disclosure to Recipient by Company; (ii)&nbsp;becomes publicly known or
        made generally available without a duty of confidentiality after disclosure to Recipient by Company through no
        action or inaction of Recipient; or (iii)&nbsp;is in the rightful possession of Recipient without
        confidentiality obligations at the time of disclosure by Company to Recipient as shown by Recipientâ€™s
        then-contemporaneous written files and records kept in the ordinary course of business; provided that any
        combination of individual items of information shall not be deemed to be within any of the foregoing exceptions
        merely because one or more of the individual items are within such exception, unless the combination as a whole
        is within such exception.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><i>Compelled Disclosure</i>.&nbsp; If Recipient becomes legally compelled to
        disclose any Confidential Information, other than pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, Recipient will
        provide Company prompt written notice of such disclosure and will assist Company in seeking a protective order
        or another appropriate remedy.&nbsp; If Company waives Recipientâ€™s compliance with this Agreement or fails to
        obtain a protective order or other appropriate remedy, Recipient will furnish only that portion of the
        Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed; provided that any Confidential Information so
        disclosed shall maintain its confidentiality protection for all purposes other than such legally compelled
        disclosure.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Non-use and Non-disclosure</u></strong></li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">Recipient shall not use any Confidential Information for any purpose except to
        evaluate and engage in discussions concerning the Opportunity.&nbsp; Recipient shall not disclose any
        Confidential Information or permit any Confidential Information to be disclosed, either directly or indirectly,
        to any third party without Companyâ€™s prior written consent.&nbsp;Recipient shall not disclose Confidential
        Information or permit the disclosure of Confidential Information to its employees, except that Recipient may
        disclose Confidential Information to those employees of Recipient who are required to have the information in
        order for Recipient to evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the Opportunity; provided that such employee
        has signed a non-use and non-disclosure agreement in content at least as protective as the provisions hereof,
        prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to such employee.&nbsp; Recipient shall not reverse
        engineer, disassemble, or decompile any prototypes, software, samples, or other tangible objects that embody the
        Confidential Information.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Maintenance of Confidentiality</u></strong></li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">Recipient shall take reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid
        disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information.&nbsp; Without limiting the foregoing, Recipient
        shall take at least those measures it employs to protect its own most highly confidential information.&nbsp;
        Recipient shall not make any copies of the Confidential Information unless the same are previously approved in
        writing by Company.&nbsp;Recipient shall reproduce Companyâ€™s proprietary rights notices on any such authorized
        copies, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.&nbsp; Recipient shall
        immediately notify Company of any unauthorized use or disclosure, or suspected unauthorized use or disclosure,
        of Confidential Information.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>No Obligation</u></strong></li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate either Party to proceed with any
        transaction between them, and each Party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the
        discussions contemplated by this Agreement concerning the Opportunity.&nbsp;Nothing in this Agreement shall be
        construed to restrict Companyâ€™s use or disclosure of its own Confidential Information.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>No Warranty</u></strong></li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED â€œAS IS.â€&nbsp; COMPANY MAKES NO
        WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE OF ANY
        CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR WITH RESPECT TO NON-INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER VIOLATION OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
        RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY OR OF RECIPIENT.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Return of Materials</u></strong></li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing Confidential
        Information and all copies or extracts thereof or notes derived therefrom that are in the possession or control
        of Recipient shall be and remain the property of Company and shall be promptly returned to Company or destroyed
        (with proof of such destruction), each upon Companyâ€™s request.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>No License</u></strong></li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to Recipient under any
        intellectual property right of Company, nor shall this Agreement grant Recipient any rights in or to the
        Confidential Information except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Term</u></strong></li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">The obligations of Recipient under this Agreement shall survive until such time as
        all Confidential Information disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known or made generally available&nbsp;through
        no action or inaction of Recipient.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Remedies</u></strong></li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">Recipient agrees that any violation or threatened violation of this Agreement will
        cause irreparable injury to Company, entitling Company to obtain injunctive relief in addition to all legal
        remedies without showing or proving any actual damage and without any bond being required to be posted.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Recipient Information</u></strong></li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">Company does not wish to receive any confidential information from Recipient, and
        Company assumes no obligation, either expressed or implied, with respect to any information disclosed by
        Recipient to Company.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">Any ideas, suggestions, guidance or other information disclosed by Recipient related
        to and any intellectual property rights relating to the foregoing shall be collectively deemed â€œ<strong>Feedback</strong>.â€
        Recipient agrees to grant and hereby grants to Company a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free,
        worldwide license (with the right to grant and authorize sublicenses) to make, have made, use, import, offer for
        sale, sell, reproduce, distribute, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works of, display, perform and otherwise
        exploit such Feedback without restriction.
    </li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Miscellaneous</u></strong></li>
    <li style="text-align:justify;">This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
        respective successors and permitted assigns; except that Recipient may not assign or otherwise transfer this
        Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, (including by merger, reorganization, consolidation, change of
        control, or sale of all or substantially all of Recipientâ€™s assets to which this Agreement pertains), without
        written consent of Company.&nbsp; Any assignment or transfer of this Agreement in violation of the foregoing
        shall be null and void.&nbsp; This Agreement will be interpreted and construed in accordance with the laws of
        the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles.&nbsp;Recipient hereby represents and
        warrants that the persons executing this Agreement on its behalf have express authority&nbsp;to do so, and, in
        so doing, to bind&nbsp;Recipient thereto.&nbsp; This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the Parties
        with respect to the Opportunity and supersedes all prior written and oral agreements between the Parties
        regarding the Opportunity. If a court or other body of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this
        Agreement, or portion thereof, to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be enforced to the maximum
        extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the Parties, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue
        in full force and effect.&nbsp; No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by a writing executed by the
        Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.&nbsp; A Partyâ€™s failure to enforce any provision of this
        Agreement shall neither be construed as a waiver of the provision nor prevent the Party from enforcing any other
        provision of this Agreement.&nbsp; No provision of this Agreement may be amended or otherwise modified except by
        a writing signed by the Parties to this Agreement.&nbsp; The Parties may execute this Agreement in counterparts,
        each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together constitute one and the same agreement.&nbsp;This
        Agreement may be delivered by facsimile transmission, and facsimile copies of executed signature pages shall be
        binding as originals.
