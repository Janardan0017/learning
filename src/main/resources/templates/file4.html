            <li style="text-align:justify;"><i>Definition</i>.&nbsp; â€œ<strong>Confidential Information</strong>â€
                means: (i) any information (including any and all combinations of individual items of information)
                disclosed (directly or indirectly) by Discloser to Recipient pursuant to this Agreement that is in
                written, graphic, machine readable or other tangible form (including, without limitation, research,

                oral information disclosed (directly or indirectly) by Discloser to Recipient pursuant to this
                Agreement; provided that such information is designated as confidential at the time of its initial
                disclosure and reduced to a written summary by Discloser that is marked in a manner to indicate its
                confidential nature and delivered to Recipient within thirty (30) days after its initial
                disclosure<strong>; and (iii)&nbsp;information otherwise reasonably expected to be treated in a
                    confidential manner under the circumstances of disclosure under this Agreement or by the nature of
                    the information itself</strong>.&nbsp; Confidential Information may include information of a third
                party that is in the possession of Discloser and is disclosed to Recipient under this Agreement.
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify;"><i>Exceptions</i>.&nbsp;Confidential Information shall not, however, include
                any information that: (i)&nbsp;was publicly known or made generally available without a duty of
                confidentiality prior to the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient; (ii)&nbsp;becomes publicly
                known or made generally available without a duty of confidentiality after disclosure by Discloser to
                Recipient through no wrongful action or inaction of Recipient; (iii)&nbsp;is in the rightful possession
                of Recipient without confidentiality obligations at the time of disclosure by Discloser to Recipient as
                shown by Recipientâ€™s then-contemporaneous written files and records kept in the ordinary course of
                business; (iv)&nbsp;is obtained by Recipient from a third party without an accompanying duty of
                confidentiality and without a breach of such third partyâ€™s obligations of confidentiality; or (v)&nbsp;is
                independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Discloserâ€™s Confidential
                Information, as shown by written records and other competent evidence prepared contemporaneously with
                such independent development; provided that any combination of individual items of information shall not
                be deemed to be within any of the foregoing exceptions merely because one or more of the individual
                items are within such exception, unless the combination as a whole is within such exception.
            </li>
            <li style="text-align:justify;"><i>Compelled Disclosure</i>.&nbsp; If Recipient becomes legally compelled to
                disclose any Confidential Information, other than pursuant to a confidentiality agreement, Recipient
                will provide Discloser prompt written notice, if legally permissible, and will use its best efforts to
                assist Discloser in seeking a protective order or another appropriate remedy.&nbsp; If Discloser waives
                Recipientâ€™s compliance with this Agreement or fails to obtain a protective order or other appropriate
                remedy, Recipient will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally
                required to be disclosed; provided that any Confidential Information so disclosed shall maintain its
                confidentiality protection for all purposes other than such legally compelled disclosure.

                not disclose any Confidential Information of Discloser to third parties or to Recipientâ€™s employees,
                except that, subject to Section&nbsp;4 below, Recipient may disclose Discloserâ€™s Confidential
                Information to those employees of Recipient who are required to have such information in order to
                evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the Opportunity.&nbsp; Recipient shall not reverse
                engineer, disassemble, or decompile any prototypes, software, samples, or other tangible objects that

                foregoing, Recipient shall take at least those measures that it employs to protect its own confidential
                information of a similar nature and shall ensure that its employees who have access to Confidential
                Information of Discloser have signed a non-use and non-disclosure agreement in content at least as
                protective of Discloser and its Confidential Information as the provisions of this Agreement, prior to
                any disclosure of Discloserâ€™s Confidential Information to such employees.&nbsp; Recipient shall not
                make any copies of the Confidential Information of Discloser unless the same are previously approved in
                writing by Discloser. Recipient shall reproduce Discloserâ€™s proprietary rights notices on any such
                authorized copies in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.&nbsp;
                Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser of any unauthorized use or disclosure, or suspected
                unauthorized use or disclosure, of Discloserâ€™s Confidential Information of which Recipient becomes
                aware.
